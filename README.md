Alright this program is just the begining of my basic artificial intelligence c++
program initially called Ai but if you run it you can change his name during
operation but he will be called Ai when you start the program unless you change it.

It was just a fun project.

Anyways install Visual Basics Community for Windows 10. Make sure to add C++ stuff
because it's a c++ console project. Then open the project file "memory.vcxproj"
with Visual Basics and press F5 when it opens to run it or just start programming
it more if you want.

Have fun I didn't add any license or anything so do what you want with it.
